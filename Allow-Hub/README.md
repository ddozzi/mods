## Description
A mod that lets you warp to a specified location, when you die in a dungeon.

## Uses
- Useful for frag running, when you die you have to wait or do /l then go to skyblock. This mod does that automatically.
- Not much else

## Usage
- /ahub config | Lets you set the amount of delay between each of the warps. I recommend using 10 - 100 for more optimized computers and 100 - 500 for slower ones.
- /ahub | Automatically warps you to the specified location.
